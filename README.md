# lol.bat
A simple recursive Windows Batch file that opens itself when triggered. Just for fun.

I wrote this when I was playing with the Windows 8.1 VM. Abusing its low RAM amount, I wanted to torture it a bit.
If you want this to open an eternity of CMD windows and seeing, you can write this yourself and even better (this repo is useless though.)
