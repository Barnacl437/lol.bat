# lol.bat
A simple recursive Windows Batch file that opens itself when triggered. Just for fun.

I wrote this when I was playing with the Windows 8.1 VM. Abusing its low RAM amount, I wanted to torture it a bit.
If you want this to open an eternity of CMD windows and seeing, you can write this yourself and even better (this repo is useless though.)

*Warning: this seems perfectly for a troll but do it with care. It may affect system stability by using a lot of system memory and can eventually crash it. You have to be able to stop this by ending `cmd.exe` process tree in Task Manager's Detail tab.*
